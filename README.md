# Dragon Cave Adventure 

*Venture into a mysterious cave to collect treasure, but tread carefully: a fire-breathing dragon slumbers within, and waking it means a fiery demise!*

Dragon Cave Adventure was created by my son and I on a rainy afternoon after exploring the White Scar Cave in the Yorkshire Dales. It took about an hour of prompting LLM's to get a workable version up and running. The cursor IDE was used along with Grok3 and Google Gemini Pro 2.5. The content in this repo is 100% AI-generated and all modifications were made through prompt engineering. All image assets were created by prompting various AI models. Audio assets were created by prompting Grok3 to write code to create the wav files. Installation instructions can be found below.
